        <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a motivated individual who loves to make positive user experiences.</p>
        <p>My interest in development began (funnily enough) during my previous experience as a physiotherapist. I worked in a variety of clinical settings which involved documenting within electronic patient records with varying degrees of usability. I got involved in a big change project for Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, building an intuitive EPR system called Hive. My experiences involved developing user interfaces, end-to-end testing and working with a variety of stakeholders. I started coding as a hobby to understand my job better, however it quickly became a passion I wanted to expand into as my future career path.</p>
        <p>A year later, I'm now completing a coding bootcamp with Manchester Codes! I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge and sharing my progression here with you!</p>
